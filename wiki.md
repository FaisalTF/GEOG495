[The Houston Rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Rockets) had what is conventionally talked about as one of the greatest teams to never win a championship during the 2017-2018 season. The Rockets clinched the first seed in the regular season with 65 wins, and moved on til the Western Conference Finals in the playoffs, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in 7 games. 


## Pre-Season
Coming out of the 2016-2017 season, where the rockets finished at the 3rd seed with 55 wins but lost to the Spurs in the Western Conference Semi Finals, the rockets made a blockbuster trade during the off season; the Rockets brought on board All-Star point guard [Chris Paul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Paul) from the Lost Angeles Clippers, by sending a package in return (including players like Montrez Harrell, Lou Williams, and more). Many were critical about the Rockets' plan to play with two ball-dominant guards.


## The Regular Season
The Rockets ended up clinching the first seed in the western conference, winning 65 games through the season - also *breaking the previoius franchise record*. James Harden was named an all-star (and later all-nba), while also winning the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award.


## Playoffs
- The Rockets faced the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round of the playoffs, moving on after winning the series in 5 games (4-1). 

- The second round had the Rockets face the Utah Jazz, which also saw the series end in 5 games (4-1) and the Houston Rockets moving onto the Western Conference Finals, where they faced the Golden State Warriors. 

The warriors had recently broke the NBA record of 73 wins within a season, as well as saw the addition of multiple time MVP Kevin Durant afterwards. The rockets lead the series by game 5 at (3-2), but foresaw Chris Paul fall due to an injury. The rockets ended up losing the two following games, breaking a record by missing 27 consecutive three pointers in game 7, and getting eliminated. The warriors moved on to win the finals in 5 games.
